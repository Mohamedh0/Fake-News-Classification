# Fake News Detection with Machine Learning ðŸ¤–ðŸ“°

I'm thrilled to share my latest data science project: **Fake News Classification**. Using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, I built a model that detects fake news with impressive accuracy. 

## Project Highlights
### âœ… Dataset
- **WELFake Dataset**: A comprehensive dataset containing thousands of labeled news articles.  

### âœ… Methods
1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Tokenization
   - Normalization
   - TF-IDF Vectorization
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized word patterns in fake vs. real news using bar charts and word clouds.
3. **Modeling**:
   - Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** for text classification.

### ðŸŽ¯ Results
- Achieved an **accuracy of 95%**.
- Gained insights into common patterns distinguishing fake vs. real news articles.
